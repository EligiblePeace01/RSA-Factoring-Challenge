RSA Data Security, which is now known as RSA Security, launched the well-known cryptography challenge known as the RSA Factoring Challenge, also sometimes referred to as the RSA-768 Challenge. Due to the difficulty of factoring big semiprime values, RSA is a popular public key encryption technique. The goal of the challenge was to evaluate the robustness of the RSA encryption technique and to promote large-number factoring research.
